Tom Christiansen gave three fabulous talks about Unicode and Perl at OSCON
2011.  They used to be available at http://training.perl.com/OSCON2011/ and
then at http://98.245.80.27/tcpc/OSCON2011/, but eventually that too
disappeared.

I've downloaded the most recent versions of two of the talks from the Internet
Archive's Wayback Machine and archived them in this repository:

* Perl Unicode Essentials
* Unicode Support Shootout: The Good, The Bad, & the (mostly) Ugly

archive.org's injected JS and HTML has been stripped out.
